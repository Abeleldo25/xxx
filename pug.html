            <h2><strong>Pug</strong></h2>
            <p>
                The pug is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed
                muscles.

                The Pug is often described as a lot of dog in a small space. These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American Kennel Clubâ€™s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of the canine world because they have a great sense of humor and like to show off.
